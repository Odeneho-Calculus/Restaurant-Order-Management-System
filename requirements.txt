# Restaurant Order Management System - Requirements
#
# This system is built using only Python standard library modules,
# ensuring maximum compatibility and minimal dependencies.
#

#
# Standard library modules used:
# - tkinter (GUI framework)
# - csv (data persistence)
# - datetime (timestamp handling)
# - decimal (precise monetary calculations)
# - pathlib (cross-platform file paths)
# - logging (application logging)
# - uuid (unique identifier generation)
# - json (data serialization)
# - shutil (file operations)
# - re (regular expressions for validation)
# - os (operating system interface)
# - sys (system-specific parameters)
# - typing (type hints for better code quality)
# - enum (enumerated constants)

# No external dependencies required!
# All functionality is implemented using Python's built-in modules.
